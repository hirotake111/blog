# DNS client

A super simple DNS client. It only supports querying a single A record at this moment.

### Usage

```bash
cargo run -- "<domain name>"

# or
cargo build
 ./target/debug/dns_client "<domain name>"
```

This code is only for my learning purpose. Feel free to try it. But do not use in production.
